# aubsmugg-block-test
An assessment challenge for potential WP developer candidates

### The Challenge:
A custom plugin has been started with the goal of creating a section block for a client website. 
Finish the section block so when added into the WP editor it is initialized with a core/heading and core/paragraph block, while restricting the allowed block types to the core heading, paragraph and button blocks.

### Helpful Hints:
Make sure NPM is installed on your machine to run the block scripts.
Leverage the <InnerBlocks> compentent to help with your development.
